# User-to-User Sales Feature Implementation

## Overview

This feature implements a user-to-user sales system where users can buy products that were originally submitted by other users through the UserProductRequest system. When such purchases occur, both the buyer and the original product submitter can track these transactions.

## How It Works

### 1. Product Submission & Approval Flow
1. **User Submits Product**: User submits a product request via "Add Product Request"
2. **Seller Approval**: Seller reviews and approves the request
3. **Product Creation**: When approved, the product is added to the catalog with `originalSubmitterId` field tracking who submitted it
4. **Available for Purchase**: The product becomes available for other users to buy

### 2. Purchase & Tracking Flow
1. **Customer Purchase**: Any user can buy the approved product
2. **Order Creation**: Order is created with product information including original submitter data
3. **Seller Dashboard**: Seller sees the order with special indicators showing it contains user-submitted products
4. **User Sales Dashboard**: Original submitter can view orders where their products were purchased
