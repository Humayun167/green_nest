// Backend API Endpoints to Test:
const API_ENDPOINTS = {
    // User endpoints
    submitRequest: 'POST /api/user-product-request/submit',
    getUserRequests: 'GET /api/user-product-request/user-requests',
    
    // Seller endpoints
    getAllRequests: 'GET /api/user-product-request/all-requests',
    approveRequest: 'POST /api/user-product-request/approve',
    rejectRequest: 'POST /api/user-product-request/reject'

// Frontend Routes to Test:
const FRONTEND_ROUTES = {
    addProductRequest: '/add-product-request',
    myProductRequests: '/my-product-requests',
